# FinOps Foundation TAC Contributor Role

The Technical Advisory Council (TAC) Contributors are a subset of FinOps Foundation (F2) community members who are collectively called "TAC Contributors".  


F2 community members that are selected for this role are considered subject matter experts and have an established knowledge-base in FinOps through their own experience and through engagement with the F2 community via WGs, SIGs and Slack conversations.

TAC Contributors are non-voting members of the F2 TAC that work alongside [the F2 TAC voting members](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/tac) and contribute to initiatives that support [the FinOps Foundation's objectives](https://www.finops.org/about/). They are expected to follow [the FinOps Foundation TAC's code of conduct](/codeofconduct.md).

#### FinOps Foundation Objectives
The high level objectives of the FinOps Foundation are:
1. Be the Central Community for Cloud FinOps,
2. Advance Careers of FinOps Practitioners, and
3. Be the Standard for FinOps Best Practices

These objectives are developed by the F2 Governing Board (GB) and TAC, in collaboration with the F2 Staff, to support the FinOps Foundation's mission. The F2's objectives will be used by the F2 staff to group,  plan,  and  drive operational activities within the FinOps Foundation.

### FAQ

#### Do TAC Contributors need to be certified as a FinOps Certified Practitioner (FOCP certification)?
> Having an FOCP certification is not a prerequisite for being selected as a TAC Contributor but is highly beneficial for potential members for being selected.


#### What is expected from TAC Contributors?
> The expectation of a TAC Contributor is to be actively involved in initiatives that contribute to the F2's mission, including participating in F2 Working Groups (WG) and Special Interest Group (SIG) projects.  Additionally, TAC Contributors should attend  TAC meetings to provide updates and insights about F2 initiatives for which they are involved.  As a non-voting member of the TAC, they represent  the bridge between the TAC and the F2 community internally, advising and engaging on the frontline as a FinOps SME.


#### Who can be a TAC Contributor?
> Any F2 community member.  We do not have any restrictions on the roles that are eligible to become TAC Contributor; this includes practitioners, vendor members, consultants and cloud service providers. However, TAC Contributors must still adhere to the rules/guidelines set by the FinOps Foundation (eg. only practitioners may lead WGs; 1 WG / consultant, â€¦etc).



#### How do F2 community members become TAC Contributors?
> Candidates must be F2 members.  Candidates may nominate themselves by filling out the information requested in [the candiate sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3_FfEYR1VYiSwfMbbzgc5i10wJhIsKeT7vOXtVqe90/edit?usp=sharing) and providing it to a member of the F2 staff for review by the TAC.  Additionally, the GB members, TAC members and F2 staff may propose community members to this role.  Once proposed, the TAC will vote to approve them joining the Technical Advisory Council as a TAC Contributor.



#### What considerations are used to determine a community member is a TAC Contributor candidate?
> The TAC may take into consideration any of the following criteria when reviewing a candidate for the TAC Contributor role.
- activity and contributions through WGs/SIGs that result in deliverables which benefit the F2 community
- activity and contributions through the F2 Slack that uplifts community tribal knowledge
- experience as a FinOps practitioner
- TAC meeting attendance
- Objective Group meeting attendance
- content individually contributed and published to the F2 website that is a resource to the F2 community
- content individually contributed and published that is available as a resources to the F2 community



#### Are TAC Contributors just F2 Ambassadors?
> TAC Contributors are not the same as F2 Ambassadors. A TAC Contributor is focused on helping the F2 by engaging with practitioners internally to the F2 through WGs, Slack, SIGs, etc.  By comparison, F2 Ambassadors focused on spreading the word/learnings about F2 and FinOps knowledge to the broader community by hosting and organizing public events, meet-ups, etc...




#### Why would anyone want to be a TAC Contributor?
> TAC Contributors will be able to raise their profile in the broader FinOps community by being part of this SME group, including being celebrated both in FinOps Summit announcements and having public profiles on finopsdotorg.  Additionally, serving as a TAC Contributor will provide a pathway for community members to eventually become TAC voting members. It's worth mentioning that while being a TAC Contributor is not a prerequisite for becoming a TAC voting-member, it is helpful when considering a candidate given the expectation of their involvement internally with the F2's WGs, & SIGs.
